# The L0 Markup Language

The L0 Markup language takes inspiration from Lisp. 
Text in L0 consists of _blocks_ and _elements_.
An element is a span of ordinary text or a function
element like `[i blocks]`, where `i` (for "italic") is
the function and the rest of the text up to the matching
right bracket, in this case "blocks", is the function
argument. Function elements can be nested, e.g.,
`[i [b blocks]]`.  In this case "blocks" is rendered
in bold italic.  One could also write `[i special [b blocks]]`, 
in which case "special" would be italicized and "blocks"
would be rendered in bold italic.

There are a few special elements: text enclosed
in backticks for inline code, and text enclosed in 
dollar signs for inline mathematics, e.g., $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

There are three kinds of blocks: anonymous blocks (paragraphs), 
named blocks, and verbatim blocks. Blocks are bounded
above and below by one or more blank lines. An anonymous block,
aka paragraph, is a sequence of elements containing no
blank lines.  Named and verbatim blocks consist of a header
and a body. The header is a line of the form `| Name Arguments`
in the case of a named block.  In the case of a verbatim
block, the header takes the form `|| Name Arguments`.  The
body is a sequence of elements containing no
blank lines.  Blocks may be indented, thus defining a tree
structure.
