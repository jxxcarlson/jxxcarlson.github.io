# Scripta Developer Docs

## The Scripta Project

Scripta is an editing and publishing system for technical
documents (mathematics, physics, etc.). It consists
of four components

- [Demo app](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/scripta-compiler-example1/) .
No login required.
You can edit the text you see there or create something entirely new.
Your edits will not be saved.
- [Scripta.io](https://scripta.io), a web app with a 
searchable store of documents.  No login required to
search for and read public documents.
- [Scripta Desktop](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-tauri/releases), for 
  Mac OS (fat binary), soon to be cross-compiled for Linux and Windows. 
  A desktop version of Scripta.io.
- [The Scripta compiler](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/docs-scripta-compiler/).  This
is the engine which makes all of the above work.


The compiler and the applications are written in 
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org), a
pure functional language that compiles to Javascript.  See the 
Tech Stack  section below for more information.

## Compiler

The Scripta compiler supports three markup languages

- L0
- MicroLaTeX
- XMarkdown

L0 has a syntax inspired by Lisp; MicroLaTeX is
an implementation of LaTeX, and XMarkdown is
like Markdown, but with some extra features,
e.g., TeX-style mathematical text.

See this  [live example](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/scripta-compiler-example1/)
for a simple demonstration of microLaTeX 
([source code here](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-compiler/tree/main/Example1)). You can edit the text of the example app at will.
[Scripta.io](https://scripta.io) is a full-featured use case that
makes use of the compiler's error recovery facilities and which implements
synchronization of source and rendered text: click on rendered text to 
highlight and bring into view the corresponding source text; select
a block of source text and press ctrl-S (for "sync") to highlight the 
corresponding rendered text and bring it into view.


The compiler is open-source, with the code hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-compiler))
and with [some documentation (work in progress)](https://jxxcarlson.github.io/docs-scripta-compiler/).
See also the [example source code](https://github.com/jxxcarlson/scripta-compiler/tree/main/Example1)

## Tech stack

Both the app and the compiler are written in 
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org), a pure functional language
that compiles to Javascript.  The app also uses
the [Lamdera](https://lamdera.com/) framework, which
permits one to write both the front and the backend in
Elm.  See this [short note on Lamdera](/docs-scripta-app/lamdera/).
Mathematical text is rendered using [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and
the editor relies on [Codemirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/).
The interface to Elm for both of these is via custom elements.

Scripta Desktop is built with [Tauri.app](https://tauri.app).
See [this article](https://jxxcarlson.medium.com/elm-tauri-befa59eab403)
for some notes on how it was assembled.  Briefly, Tauri is a way
of converting a web app built with most any language/framework
including Elm into a desktop app.  It has both good security
and small asset size.


## Note

Most of the rest of this document concerns the web app and is 
intended to help the app developers.
