<h1>Simulation examples in Elm</h1>


<strong><a href="billiards.html">Billiards</a></strong>

<p> Watch biliard balls bounce off
  walls of a rectangular container and occasionally off eachother: angle of reflection
  equals angle of incidence.  <a href="https://github.com/jxxcarlson/billiards" target="_blank">Code</a>

<strong><a href="randomWalk.html">Random Walk</a></strong>

<p> Simulate one of the simplest (and fairest) gambling games. You start of with a stake
  of $4.  Then you roll a die. If it is even, you win one dollar.  If it is odd, you
  lose one dollar. You repeat this process until either you go broke or you decide to stop.

<strong><a href="brownianMotion.html">Brownian Motion</a></strong>

<p> Simulate Brownian motion.  A particle, represented by a colored disk, takes random steps to
  the left and right, up and down.  Its color also varies randomly,
  with the red and blue values changing by small random increments.  Thus the underlying
  process is really a 4-dimensional random walk with two spatial dimensions and two color
  dimensions.  A little bit like string theory, since the color dimensions are small compared to
  the spatial ones.
